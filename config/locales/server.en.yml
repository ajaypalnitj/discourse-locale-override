    'new-topic': |
      Welcome to %{site_name} &mdash; **thanks for starting a new conversation!**

      - Does the title accurately describe your topic? Does it sound interesting?

      - What is this about? Who would be interested in it? Why does it matter? What kind of responses are you hoping for from the community?

      - Include good search words in your topic so others can *find* it. To group your topic with related topics, select a category.

      For more, [see our community guidelines](/guidelines). This panel will only appear for your first %{education_posts_text}.

    'new-reply': |
      Welcome to %{site_name} &mdash; **thanks for contributing!**

      - Does your reply improve the conversation in some way?

      - Be kind to your fellow community members.

      - Constructive criticism is welcome, but criticize *ideas*, not people.

      For more, [see our community guidelines](/guidelines). This panel will only appear for your first %{education_posts_text}.

    avatar: |
      ### How about a new picture for your account?

      You've posted a few topics and replies, but your avatar isn't as unique as you are -- it's the same default avatar all new users have.

      Have you considered **[visiting your user profile](%{profile_path})** and uploading a custom image that represents you?

      It's easier to follow community discussions and find interesting people in conversations when everyone has a unique avatar!

    sequential_replies: |
      ### Consider replying to several posts at once

      Rather than many sequential replies to a topic, please consider a single reply that includes quotes from previous posts or @name references.

      You can edit your previous reply to add a quote by highlighting text and selecting the <b>quote reply</b> button that appears.

      It's easier for everyone to read topics that have fewer in-depth replies versus lots of small, individual replies.

    dominating_topic: |
      ### Let others join the conversation

      This topic is clearly important to you &ndash; you've posted more than %{percent}% of the replies here.

      Are you sure you're providing adequate time for other people to share their points of view, too?

    too_many_replies: |
      ### You have reached the reply limit for this topic

      We're sorry, but new users are temporarily limited to %{newuser_max_replies_per_topic} replies in the same topic.

      Instead of adding another reply, please consider editing your previous replies, or visiting other topics.

    reviving_old_topic: |
      ### Revive this topic?

      The last reply to this topic is now over %{days} days old. Your reply will bump the topic to the top of its list and notify anyone previously involved in the conversation.

      Are you sure you want to continue this old conversation?
